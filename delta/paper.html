<p class='paper-author'>Matthew W. Easterday, Daniel Rees Lewis, Elizabeth M. Gerber</p>
Since the first descriptions of design-based research (DBR), there have been continued calls to better define DBR and increase its rigor. Here we address four uncertainties about DBR: (a) the phases of the DBR process, (b) what distinguishes DBR from other forms of research, (c) what distinguishes DBR from design, and (d) the characteristics of DBR that make it effective for answering certain types of questions. By better articulating the process of DBR, this definition helps us to better craft, improve, communicate, and teach design-based research.

Digital Lofts for teaching design process (in engineering, science in law) can support learning through 3 interelated feedback loops: (a) a crowd critique loop in which learners receive formative feedback on their innovation work from a broader community, (b) a case development loop in which examples of student work are semi-automatically created to provide instruction, and (c) a learner-driven instructional loop, in which self-assessments determine which group instruction is provided.

We explore if and how online crowds can support student learning in the classroom and how scalable, diverse, immediate (and often ambiguous and conflicting) input from online crowds affects student learning and motivation for project-based innovation work. We share early evidence and discuss implications for creating a socio-technical infrastructure to more effectively use crowdsourcing in education.

Drawing on theory from organizational behavior and distributed computing, as well as direct feedback from workers, we outline a framework that will enable crowd work that is complex, collaborative, and sustainable. The framework lays out research challenges in twelve major areas: workflow, task assignment, hierarchy, real-time response, synchronous collaboration, quality control, crowds guiding AIs, AIs guiding crowds, platforms, job design, reputation, and motivation.

To explore principles for designing incentives to influence the behavior of learning agents, we consider a setting in which a principle seeks to induce an adaptive agent to select a target action by providing incentives.

<p class='paper-author'>Elizabeth Gerber, Anne McKenna, Penny Hirsch, Charles Yarnoff</p>
Engineers of the future expected to be knowledgeable about the principles and practices needed to develop eco-effective products and manufacturing processes, yet it is challenging to integrate these principles and practices into undergraduate engineering design education.  We present and evaluate an approach that exposing students to cradle to cradle design and help them make progress toward developing adaptive expertise in this area.

<p class='paper-author'>Haoqi Zhang, Yiling Chen, and David C. Parkes</p>
Environment design is the problem of influencing an agent’s decisions by making changes to the agent’s environment. We present a general framework for the formulation and solution of environment design problems with one agent.

<p class='paper-author'>Easterday, M. W., Aleven, V., Scheines, R. & Carver, S. M.</p>
We present a cognitive framework for policy argumentation and show that causal diagram improve reasoning.  Having a correct diagram improves reasoning and so does practice constructing a diagram (in cases where correct diagrams are unavailable).

<p class='paper-author'>Easterday, M. W., Aleven, V., Scheines, R., & Carver, S. M.</p>
Confirmation bias in analyzing policy evidence may not arise because of biased search or biased evaluation, but because changes in beliefs after reading contradictory evidence have a very small effect on overall beliefs and because people recall the mass of evidence as supporting their current beliefs.  This suggests that a better way to alievate confirmation bias might be to provide external representations of evidence.

<p class='paper-author'>Haoqi Zhang, David C. Parkes, and Yiling Chen</p>
We study the learning and optimization problem of using rewards to induce an agent to follow a particular policy. We prove that the problem is tractable and that effective rewards can be discovered after few interactions.

<p class='paper-author'>Elizabeth Gerber</p>
We explore how designers use techniques from theatrical improvisation to adhere to the rules of brainstorming thereby enhancing group interactions while collaborating. The usefulness of improvisation for brainstorming stems from the similarity of the goals of improvisation and brainstorming, the similarity of the recurrent problems that actors and designers encounter when collaborating, and the distinctness of the ways each have devised to resolve the problems that block the group's performance.

For argument mapping software to be usuable in education they must: (a) provide appropriate visual represntations, (b) allow flexible consruction, (c) support visualogic, (d) automate nonsemantic operations, (e) allow presentation of multiple diagrams, and (f) allow cross platform campatibility.

<p class='paper-author'>Elizabeth Gerber</p>
The paper argues that improvisation can build perspectives and skills that are critical for designers, such as creative collaboration, fostering innovation, supporting spontaneity, learning through error, and presenting ideas. The applications are analyzed to demonstrate individual and group level outcomes in design work.
